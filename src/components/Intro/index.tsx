                            <p>To help you determine the <strong>best charging strategy</strong> based upon how long it takes you (on average) to drive to a charger, how long you have to wait (on average) to charge, and the average full-charge range of your vehicle.</p>

                            <strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong>
                            <p>This is not meant to be a scientifically accurate study!  I donâ€™t have access to official charging curves for EGMP cars, and the results are based entirely on estimates cobbled together from several different sources. <strong>For entertainment purposes only!</strong></p>
                            <p>In addition, this app doesn't consider the long-term effect of various charging strategies on battery health. Nor will it look at the ethical/moral question of charging to 100% when people are waiting. It only looks at one thing: <strong>TIME</strong></p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>The cars are always charged at 350 kW DC chargers at the maximum possible speed</li>
                            <li>Charging occurs at the same speed, every time.</li>
                            <li>Charging begins and ends at the same start and end charge percentage every time.</li>
